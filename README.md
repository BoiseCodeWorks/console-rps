## Goals
<hr>
For this first project students will be responsible for creating a new Console Application where Users can choose either
Rock, Paper, or Scissors and a computer will then randomly choose from those options. Each players choices should then
be displayed and the winner declared.

## The Setup
<hr>

### Step 1
You will need to take in user input that represents the players choice: "rock" "paper" or "scissors". A good name for the string might be playerChoice.

Next you will need to create a variable to hold the value for the computer's choice. For now, assign the value of computer's choice to "rock".

### Step 2
After getting both pieces of input you will need to decide who the winner is. You may wish to draw out the logic of rock paper scissors to better keep track of what wins against what.

Display the results of each players choice, and then the winner! After that, you will need to make the computer choose randomly instead of choosing 'Rock' Every time

## Requirements:
<hr>

#### Visualization
- Users are prompted to choose "Rock, Paper or Scissors"
- Both players choices are displayed
- A winner is displayed

#### Functionality
- Gracefully handles bad input without crashing
- Computer choice is random

<hr>

### Stretch Goals (Requirements first! Then stretch goals.)
- Utilize a while loop to allow the user to play multiple instances of the game during one execution of the program.
- Keep a track of the user's and computer's games won and display this stats with the other results at the end of a game.
- Extend this game to include more options, namely Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, etc.
